//NODEJS provides a runtime environment to run js code
//it has a javascript engine that can execute a js code and also has objcets that can provide environment to the js code
an object is document object in the line => document.getelementbyId('')

//architecture =>
    Non blocking / asynchronous ---> e.g. the CPU can switch between processes when it has to wait some some work to perform
    in Node --> a single thread is sued to handle multiple request 
    (Has benefit before the different architecture as it can serve more number of requests)
    cant use Node for CPU intensive apps -> only used ofr data intensive applications 

    bloacking / synchronous ---> only move to another process after one is completed
    ac.net / rails --> a different thread is given for each request
